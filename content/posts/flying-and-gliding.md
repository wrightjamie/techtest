A﻿s a member of the RAFAC, Cadets can expect to be given the opportunity to fly in a variety of military aircraft, including taking control themselves under the tuition of experienced instructors. Some will even have the opportunity to fly solo!

### Air Experience Flying

Every Cadet is excited about the idea of AEF; it is often their first chance to fly in a light aircraft and almost always the first time they've taken control. After getting airborne they'll be handed control of the aircraft under the guidance of an experienced RAF pilot and learn the basics of controlling our training aircraft; the Grob Tutor.

Before returning to earth, Cadets may be offered the chance to experience the thrill of aerobatics!

### Gliding

At the age of 16 Cadets can be offered a Gliding Induction Course which will introduce them to gliding. A thrilling winch launch will get the glider into the air from which Cadets will be greeted by silence as they soar high over the ground.

A﻿ Gliding Scholarship can follow. If the Cadet has met the required standards, then the instructor will get out and allow the Cadet to take the glider for a solo flight - likely before they have passed their driving test!

### Passenger Flights

On annual camps there is often the chance to fly in other military aircraft as a passenger. This might be in one of the RAFs various large aircraft, a helicopter or in rare occasions - one of the Royal Air Force's fast jets such as a Hawk (the one the Red Arrows fly!)

### Other Flying Opportunities

T﻿here are other flying opportunities as well - the RAFAC runs the occasional hand gliding and parachuting courses which Cadets can apply for! These are highly sought after and competition to get a place is fierce.
