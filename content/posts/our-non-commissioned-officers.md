  "Don't salute me - I work for a living"

  You'll hear this from our adult Senior NCO team whenever new Cadets mistakenly salute them... But who are they and who shouldn't they be saluted?
---

We have 3 Cadet Forces Adult Volunteer (CFAV) Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs). As non-commissioned officers they aren't saluted.

The traditional role of an SNCO is to look after drill and discipline of the Cadets, although that isn't always the case. The SNCO's within the RAFAC hold one of 3 ranks - Sergeant, Flight Sergeant or Warrant Officer.

### Warrant Officer Paul Davison

WO Davison is the Squadron Warrant Officer and ultimately responsible for the drill and discipline of all of our Cadets.

> Some words from Paul

### Warrant Officer Jamie Wright

WO Wright looks after the training programme for our Cadets.

> As an ex-Cadet I really understand the value that the RAFAC can bring to young people.

### Flight Sergeant Charlie Cartwright

FS Cartwright is one of the jewels of the Squadron. He is constantly found bouncing around the Squadron with a huge grin and a cheeky outlook. As an ex-Serviceman Charlie has a huge amount of personal experience to draw upon.
